This project is meant to be an expansion of CC:Tweaked that will add other languages to the mod. The hope is that others will help add to it as they wish. I am starting this mod off by adding an assembly language based off of the custom language made for the game Shenzhen IO by Zachatronics Games. This mod will not change to base mod other than the lanuage that the copmuter uses.
